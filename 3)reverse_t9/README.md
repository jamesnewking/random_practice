 /*landline and some mobile phones have letters on their 
 numbers corresponding to particular letters.  for some old 
 flip phones, to type letters, you had to press the number 
 corresponding to the letter to get that particular letter.
 
 write a function that emulates this functionality.
 for example, 22 is b, 666 is o, 9999 is z.
 
 Here is a list of letters on each number
 2 is abc
 3 is def
 4 is ghi
 5 is jkl
 6 is mno
 7 is pqrs
 8 is tuv
 9 is wxyz
 
 if two letters would require the same sequential number, 
 like a followed by b, a space will separate them.
 for example 2 222 22 would be acb
 22334 would be beg
